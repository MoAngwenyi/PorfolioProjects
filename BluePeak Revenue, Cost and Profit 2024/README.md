# Project Overview & Background

BluePeak Holdings is a mid-sized enterprise operating across multiple regions and product categories. The finance team needed a centralized solution to track monthly financial performance, monitor sales efficiency, and analyze profitability across sales channels, regions, and product lines. Prior to this, performance reviews relied on static spreadsheets with limited granularity and interactivity.
The finance team needed the following insights revealed through the cleaning and analyzing of the data available in the following categories:
- Revenue Performance by Region, Channel & Time
- Product & Sales Performance
- Profitability by Category & Discount Behavior


# Data Structure 

The dataset had one google sheet of 50,000 rows with columns seen in the figure below.

This Power BI dashboard was developed as a modern financial analytics solution, leveraging Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and DAX measures for revenue, profit, and margin calculations. The solution provides the executive team with real-time insights into the company’s financial health.

# Executive Summary
- In 2024, BluePeak Holdings generated KES 37M in revenue and KES 13.26M in profit, resulting in a profit margin of 38.17%. The company maintained a strong monthly revenue stream with relatively consistent margins throughout the year. Regional performance was evenly distributed, with Kisumu, Eldoret, Nakuru, Mombasa, and Nairobi each contributing between 19%–21% of total revenue.

- Sales channels — Mobile App, Online, and Physical Stores performed nearly equally, suggesting well-balanced customer engagement. However, product category profitability varied significantly. While Electronics and Home & Garden led in profit, categories like Books and Sports underperformed.

- The dashboard also revealed that deeper discounts often resulted in lower average profits per transaction, emphasizing the need to better align promotional strategies with revenue goals.

# Insights Deep Dive
## A. Revenue Performance by Region, Channel & Time

- Monthly Revenue & Profit remained relatively stable with slight peaks mid-year, suggesting a consistent customer base rather than seasonal surges.
- Regional Sales Distribution was almost evenly split among the top 5 cities, showing a well-penetrated national market.
- Sales Channels (Mobile App, Online, Physical) were nearly tied, each generating approx. KES 12M+, which confirms an effective omnichannel strategy.

## B. Product & Sales Performance
- Average Transaction Value across all categories hovered around KES 730–740, indicating pricing consistency.
- Total Quantity Sold was highest in Electronics and Home & Garden, both also leading in revenue and order volume.
- Payment Methods were also evenly distributed, with PayPal, Cash, and Credit Cards making up nearly equal proportions — suggesting no heavy reliance on a single method.

## C. Profitability by Category & Discount Behavior

- Profitability varied widely by category. Electronics and Home & Garden showed the highest profit contribution (~KES 2M each), while categories like Books and Sports lagged behind.
- A clear inverse relationship was observed between discount percentage and average profit per transaction — meaning higher discounts often hurt profitability more than they drove volume.

# Recommendations:
- Reassess Discount Strategies:
Consider limiting deep discounting, especially in low-margin categories like Books and Sports. Explore bundling or loyalty-based promotions instead.
- Optimize High-Performing Categories:
Invest in marketing and stock expansion for top-performing categories like Electronics and Home & Garden to grow share and maintain profitability.
- Expand in Underutilized Regions:
While regional sales are evenly split, cities like Kisumu and Nakuru are slightly ahead — consider regional campaigns or local partnerships to solidify dominance.
- Channel-Based Personalization:
With all channels performing equally, personalized offers or exclusive products by channel (e.g. app-only flash deals) could improve engagement and margin.
- Monitor Transaction Value Over Time:
Maintain or grow average transaction values by upselling related products and reducing single-product orders through smarter cross-selling.
