Glow skin is a e-commerce company specializing in skincare based in Nairobi, Kenya and serving 5 african countries.
The KPIs we are investigating are these metrics- ie sales, customers, and products in a span of 4 months April - August 2024.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Category 1: WHAT IS THE TOTAL SALES FOR THE 4 MONTHS? HIGHEST SELLING MONTH?

Category 2: WHAT IS THE MOST ORDERED PRODUCT?

Category 3: WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SALES CHANNEL?

# Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the MARKETING TEAM to consider the following:

- Find out why the Glow Moisturizer is the least selling product . Is it that its not formulated well? Or are customers preferring some other type of moisturizer that GlowSkin can start stocking.
- Find out why May and June performed better compared to April and July and use that to improve overall sales.
- Although GlowSkin made KES 33,340 in its 4 months of operation with 20 product types, its abit low. The marketing team should improve their marketing channels and methods to be more profitable.
