# CYCLISTIC BIKE SHARE ANALYSIS

The dataset provided was large and I decided to work with Q1 of 2023, I used Python to clean the dataset as it has useful functions.

I had 4 CSV files that I merged.

Removed the null values through dropna() function.

Check for duplicates.

Added a few columns like start month and start year.

Exported the Python file into a CSV that was now ready for visualization.

### Tools used:
CSV for data collection, Python for cleaning and analyzing, Power BI for visualization.

### Trends and patterns were identified through the process of exploration.

These were some of them:

Total Trips Taken - 0.86bn for classic bikes, 0.64bn for electric bokes, and 0.03bn fro docked bikes.

Types of Bicycles Used - Electrical, Classical and docked.

Trips Taken every month (Jan, Feb, March, and April of 2023)

Trips Taken in daily.

Average trip distance and trip duration - 2.2 and 12.7mins respectively.
